# windows in my crib

**tldr;**
_window creation in zig made me sad, so i went with rust instead_

### a very good place to start

let's start from the very beginning, and put a smile on julie andrews' face.
i set out to make this a [rust]() app, then promptly got whispers of [zig]().
heard about ghostty, got interested, cloned, reviewed, and got sad. [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/), a terminal emulator written in [zig](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.1/)
(zig resources: [book](https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/), [karl seguin](https://www.openmymind.net/learning_zig/), [ziglings](https://ziglings.org/))
by [mitch hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/) (he flies a [cirrus](https://cirrusaircraft.com/aircraft/vision-jet/), by the way!!!) is currently avaialable for linux
(wayland, i think), and mac.
i looked around to see how window creation was handled and found it was handled natively.


### this is where we are
i have made the executive decision to stick with tauri + [svelte](https://svelte.dev/). i would have gone with react, but i wanted something much lighter; bonus for being declarative.

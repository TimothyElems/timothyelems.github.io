<p>to fully ascend to senior swe status, i have created a blog documenting my current projects, and i&rsquo;m writing in the god-forsaken <code>sentence.lower(obviously-python)</code>. this starts my journey of learning rust &ndash;notice i did not say &ldquo;becoming a rustacean&rdquo;. python will forever be in my heart, and until (if ever) zig changes its string primitive, it&rsquo;ll remain only in my mind.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-project">why the project?</h3>
<p>i run a sequoia on a 2012 macbook pro(<a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/">oclp</a>)! somewhere along the lines of the upgrade, i lost certain functionality, and gained a major one: lag. camera stopped working, drivers got outdated, processing got drastically slower, and the fans! oh the fans!<br>
this really would have little to no effect on me save on thing: i need to use facebook messenger. the upgrade from sonoma to sequoia took out the smoothness of messenger desktop and made it clunkier than a shoebox of mixed lego sets <!-- Change up this sentence-->. i tried to make the switch to using the web based version, and boy was that fun. having 100 tabs open (all of which were ESSENTIAL within the next 48hrs) did very little to reduce the lag. i could not use the messenger app cause its features got buggy, and could not use the web cause it too was slow. i knew my only option was to build a browser.<br>
the browser aims to be as small as possible, using the least amount of cpu power and using the least amount of ram as possible. for this reason, i picked a language with a library for building windows and working ui. tauri is the main engine powering the app. the reason i went with rust for the backend is it has within it&rsquo;s std lib all the tools needed without external libs, and the frontend is written in vanilla typesscript (would have gone with dioxus, but i&rsquo;m not too familiar with it). as much as possible the project will be executed without external depencies, unless they unequivocally are faster than stock rust libs.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-name">why the name?</h3>
<p>i have had the fortune/misfortune of being in long distance relationships. the strength of these lies in the strength and for the most part, frequency of communication. along the way, i met who i am <em>convinced</em> is my life partner! i did not believe in soulmates til she came along! so naturally all my time was spent with her. instagram, whatsapp, facebook, emails, and even linkedin &ndash;we used whatever was available to us. the first half (a bit longer than half, maybe 2/3), was the most blissful period of both of our lives. middle of this year, we hit a snag and things got a little sour. we fought and fought, both <em>against</em> each other and <em>for</em> what we had. we tried and tried, but the distance had been created.</p>
<p>this is my attempt to make it work! building this browser, having it run at blazing speeds, all so i can reconnect with my person! my Luna!</p>
<p>sempre💙</p>

<!-- In an alternate universe, this is the story of a man that would rather build a new browser than close old tabs -->
